# ESP32-Radio-TTGO
ESP32 Internet Radio with Display 

## Introduction
Existing radios or loudspeakers will be used in order to get decent sound quality.
The display should show relevant information and the font size should not be too small.

Most of the time you just want to switch the device on and listen to the music.
There are only two things you want to change: volume and radio station.
Nevertheless there is only one dial to cover both functions.

In addition there is a webserver including song covers as well as mqtt to allow integration into home automation.

## Setup
### WiFi Manager
Upon first boot, the wifi  manager will start and ask for wifi credntials as well as mqtt setting.
### Radio Stations
10 stations can be configured using the four parameters below.
- RadioName = 1Live
- RadioURL = http://wdr-1live-live.icecast.wdr.de/wdr/1live/live/mp3/128/stream.mp3
- RadioTitleSeperator = -
- RadioTitleFirst = Artist
